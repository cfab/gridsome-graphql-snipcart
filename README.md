![gridsome-demo](https://snipcart.com/media/203990/gridsome-airtable-tutorial.png)

Hard to argue against the fact that Vue.js and GraphQL have made significant waves in the ever-growing JS pond.

Now, what if I told you that the tool leveraging both to build powerful websites and apps has arrived? Yes, Vue.js finally found its Gatsby, and it’s called Gridsome.

It quickly caught the attention of our team and here I’m putting it to the test by building my own Vue & GraphQL-powered e-commerce app.This tutorial will highlight some of Gridsome’s neat features while using Airtable as a handcrafted database.

Steps:

- Creating a Gridsome project
- Handling a products sheet in Airtable
- Crafting a Gridsome data source plugin to fetch products from Airtable
- Querying data with GraphQL
- Building Vue.js views & listing
- Adding the buy button
